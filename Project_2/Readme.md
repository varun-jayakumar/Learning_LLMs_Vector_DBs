# RAG with Atlas Vector Search, Langchain and OpenAI

- Minimize hallucinations
- Although RAG does not increase Models token limit - it provides only relavent information to the model to be able to respond accurately

## Technologies we will use

- Langchain - standard interface for chain and lots of integration with tools
  - Sequence of comonents coupled together to perform language tasks
- Graio - used to build UI fordata amd ML applications
- OPENAPI api to
  - Embedding model
  - Large language model to generate text

# Notes 

- Vector DB embeddings
They are a digital way of sorting and storing items - List of numbers (called a vector) - similar items have similar numbers - These vectors are created by ML models (huggyface, OpenAI, Cohere) - These ML models are created with complex match that sees how pixels, words are arranged and generates a vector

- Vector Search
Method used to find and retrive information most similar to given query - instead of exact matches - tries to understand context and meaning of Queries. Vecctor search can be ised for semantic searches - it can effificently search and rank the most similar items

- Mango DB Atlas Vector search
Let us do the search - These vector data is stored as Documents in case of MongoDB - They can be queried using a aggregation pipeline to perform fast semantic similarity search on Data


- Project 1: Semantic search for movie recommendations
